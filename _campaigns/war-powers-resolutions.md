title: Pass the War Powers Resolutions

## Issue

The US has been providing the Saudi coalition with arms sales, targeting and mid-air refueling for airstrikes, and diplomatic support. The Saudi coalition has been visiting a campaign of collective punishment on Yemen, targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, which has lead to the worldâ€™s greatest humanitarian crisis since World War Two.

## Fighting back

A bipartisan group of US legislators have been pushing for legislation to end unconstitutional US support for the criminal Saudi campaign in Yemen.

## Get involved

We demand NY reps support legislation ending US involvement in the Saudi coalition, through direct actions and advocacy with local partner orgs, and Yemeni-American organizations.
