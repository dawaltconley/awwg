## Issue

600 Palestinian children in the occupied West Bank are detained every year in the Israeli military detention system. This a system without any recourse to due process or human rights, where children are denied legal counsel, where three in four are subject to physical violence or torture, where 99% are criminally convicted, and all are coerced into signing confessions in a foreign language.

## Fighting back

The U.S. currently provides unconditional military aid to Israel. The Promoting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Detention of Palestinian Children Act (HR 4391) would require that no US military aid to Israel go toward detention of Palestinian children and violations of Palestinian children’s human rights. This is the only ongoing initiative to make US aid to Israel conditional upon respect for Palestinian rights (i.e. the ‘S’ in ‘BDS’).

## Get involved

HR 4391 has 31 signatories in congress-- none from New York. We’re campaigning to get New York’s congressional delegation to sign on to HR 4391, by petitioning in support of the bill ([click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAJESBmPlGpnC2Cl5xXGFR_fk9TCPUbfMiZcWUdZ6VGY7SXA/viewform) to sign our petition), and arranging meetings with New York congressional representatives, urging their support for existing legislation.

## Partner organizations

HR 4391 is part of the No Way To Treat A Child (NWTTAC) campaign, lead by Defense for Children International Palestine (DCIP), a Palestinian NGO based in the occupied Palestinian territories.
