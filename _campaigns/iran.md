In the past two years, the United States has pulled out of an internationally negotiated and approved deal that, while in place, prevented further conflict and opened the door to normalizing relations with Iran. Instead, the United States has imposed brutal sanctions on Iran which primarily hurt middle and working class Iranians, causing them to lose access to basic necessities such as food and medicine. These actions by the United States have played right into the predictions of the right-wing in Iran who said that the United States could not be trusted. As a result, the United States has silenced the voices of peace movements, moderates, leftists, workers, feminists, and environmentalists who supported the deal and were open to peaceful relations with the West. 



The Trump administration claims that it wants to force Iran to the negotiating table, but this is a lie. They do not want to negotiate. Iran already agreed to and complied with an effective deal. We have seen this pattern before. Crippling sanctions and threats of violence are meant to foment regime change in Iran, advance American financial interests in the region, and distract us from domestic policies that continue to make the United States the most unequal nation in the world.



This campaign will be targeted at the American public and government. We will oppose war, violence, and American imperialism regardless of any objectionable actions the Iranian government may take. Neither will we work with any person that is affiliated with or hired by the Iranian government, official or semi-official state media, or anyone who is thought to be part of any specific political faction inside of Iran. A key tenet of this campaign is that we, as people living in the United States, must oppose our own governmentâ€™s undemocratic and violent actions. Most importantly, war would be a disaster for the American and Iranian people. We can oppose US military intervention and sanctions in Iran without apologizing for or supporting the Iranian government.



For a long time, Iran has been a scapegoat for imperialist, capitalist players in U.S. politics. While Iranians have suffered as a result of sanctions and live in a state of siege thanks to the ever-present threat of war, Americans have suffered as a result of a ballooning military budget that sucks resources away from public schools, hospitals and other programs on which our communities rely. This campaign will build power by educating people in the U.S. about how and why Iran has been demonized in the American political discourse, by publicizing the horrific consequences of a potential military conflict with Iran, and by encouraging people in the U.S. to hold their elected representatives accountable for preventing such a conflict. The campaign will further seek to highlight the relevance of this issue to the larger anti-war/anti-imperialist movement. 



Finally, as part of opposing the economic warfare that is U.S. sanctions policy in Iran and challenging pervasive anti-Iranian sentiment, this campaign will gather stories from Iranians about the impact of sanctions on their lives. We will gather first-hand accounts from across a wide swath of Iranian society and make these accounts accessible and shareable via social media. The goal is to bring the reality of sanctions home to people in the U.S. so they have a more accurate picture of what the U.S. government is doing in their name. Hopefully, exposure to the direct, human cost of sanctions will galvanize more people into taking action against these policies and will make it that much harder to convince ordinary Americans that people in Iran are their enemy. Instead, we will offer a fresh perspective: that Americans and Iranians deserve affordable food and health care, decent jobs with livable wages, and a society free from militarism, violence and oppression in all its forms.
