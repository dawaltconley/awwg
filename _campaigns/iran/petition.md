Sanctions are economic warfare, preventing ordinary Iranians from accessing the medicine and basic necessities they need to survive. Sanctions are collective punishment, plunging people into poverty and placing the entire population under siege. Rather than an alternative to war, sanctions pave the way for war. We don’t need another unnecessary war--and we don’t need to perpetuate another humanitarian crisis.
