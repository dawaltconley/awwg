The NYC-DSA Anti-War Working Group stands in solidarity with those living in occupied Palestine. We demand that the government of Israel adhere to international law and cease its illegal occupation of the West Bank and its brutal campaign of collective punishment against those living in Gaza. We demand that Israel honor the basic human rights of Palestinians, including their right of return, as recognized in [UN General Assembly Resolution 194](https://www.un.org/unispal/data-collection/general-assembly/).
