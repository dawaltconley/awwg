title: NYC-DSA Anti-War Working Group
description: |
  The Anti-War Working Group coordinates the efforts the 
  [New York City](http://www.socialists.nyc/) branch of the 
  [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/), 
  the largest socialist organization in the United States.
  
  We are dedicated to countering US imperialism and resisting 
  US regime-change operations and interventions in foreign wars 
  and conflicts. Our goal is to disrupt the US war machine in 
  New York City by building grassroots power and working with 
  other anti-war groups. Our struggle will advance the fight 
  for a truly international socialism, in which all people, 
  regardless of nationality, are liberated from want, fear, 
  violence, and coercion.
