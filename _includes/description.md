The Anti-War Working Group coordinates the efforts the [New York City](http://www.socialists.nyc/) branch of the [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/), the largest socialist organization in the United States.

We are dedicated to countering US imperialism and resisting US regime-change operations and interventions in foreign wars and conflicts. Our goal is to disrupt the US war machine in New York City by building grassroots power and working with other anti-war groups. Our struggle will advance the fight for a truly international socialism, in which all people, regardless of nationality, are liberated from want, fear, violence, and coercion.

To get involved with our working group, email [antiwar@socialists.nyc](mailto:antiwar@socialists.nyc).
